### Part 2 (75 pts)

I would first tell my boss and anyone else that I am supposed to report my audit to.
This is because the most important thing that needs to done in this situation is to
fix the problems before anyone is injured.  Depending on the severity of the issues
and how likely they are to be exploited, I would then ask for a recall or some other formal
statement to be made by the company to let the consumers know about the problem.
However, if the company refused to address the problem as well as not fix it, then
I believe taking the story public or to some consumer protection agency would be the right
thing to do.

I believe telling the company about the problems is the very minimum that should be done in
this situation.  Any action taken beyond that is dependent on the severity of the issue
and the potential consequences that not taking action might result in. For example, if the 
problem could result in the deaths of many people, then taking the issue public would be
the right thing to do.  If the issue was extremely unlikely to occur, car damage would be minimal, and injury to the occupants wouldn't be severe, then I don't think taking it public is
always required.

I think if I were to do absolutely nothing, then I would definitely be partially responsible 
for any harm that results.  I could have taken action to get work started on fixing the issue 
and notify the public about potential dangers, but instead I did nothing and allowed it to happen.
The fault would not be solely mine though because the issue really shouldn't have existed in
the first place and it is possible that many injuries or damages would have still occurred 
within the 6 months that it would take to fix the issue.
